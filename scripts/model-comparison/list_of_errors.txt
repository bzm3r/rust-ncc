* drop frac_rgtp from CharQuants, it is not properly normalizing
init Rho GTPase distributions

* use cytoplasmic force of 1e-5

* fix coa distribution exponent, under impl RawCoaParams refine.
Should be 0.5f32.ln() / range, not 0.5f32.ln() / (range * 0.5)
    -> more correctly, set coa_range = 220, so that halfmax
    occurs at 0.5 * 220 = 110

* in gen_coa, fix so that *x_coa[i] += ..., not *x_coa[i] = ...

* replace line segment calculations with new ones in python-compare, just to be sure

* set randomization std factor to 0.1

* average CIL over neighbour nodes for kgtps_rho
    -> should CIL/CAL be averaged over neighbour nodes?

* consider putting in point in poly check for ClosePoint
calcs (useful for CIL in particular?)


Following are not errors, but recommended changes:
1) remove char kgtp/kdgtp, and only have char kgtp
2) rename halfmax_vertex_rgtp_act to halfmax_vertex_rgtp
3) remove tot_rac, tot_rho
4) replace tot_rgtp with 1.0
5) should move k_mem_on/k_mem_off out of CharQuants and 
    into WorldParameters
6) make gen_default_viscosity use eta from CharQuants, and
rename gen_default_viscosity to gen_default_vertex_velocity
7) make connection between general eta, and "2D eta" that we
use clear. In general:
    F/A = eta * v/x
    (v = velocity, F = force, A = area, x = length)
A in our case can be taken to be the height of the
lamellipod * the resting edge length. F is the protrusive
force, and we know F/A, since we know the lamellipod
stall stress. We know we want a v of around 3 micrometers/s
It remains for us to determine what x should be. Idea:
choose it to be 1 micrometer, so that eta is 1e5 * 1e-6 =
1e-1 (1e5 comes from order of magnitude, 1e-6 is 1 microm)
